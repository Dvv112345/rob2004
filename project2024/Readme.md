# Installation instructions

You can run the Jupyter notebook for the project using a local installation of Python on your computer. Please reach out as soon as possible if you have issues doing this.

You will need to have a local installation of Python (>3.7 recommended). We recommend that you install Python using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/index.html)

You then will need to install 
1. [Pybullet](https://pybullet.org/wordpress/), which is the simulator

With a Conda installation, you can run the following:
``conda install pybullet``

With pip you can install it with
``pip install pybullet``

Or refer to the installation instruction on the Pybullet website.

Your environment should then be all set to run the Notebook.
